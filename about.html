  Step into Café Zoe in the day, and you will be delighted with the radiant sunlight streaming through big glass windows, exposed brick walls and high ceilings over a 4000 sq. ft. space. 

    This Café, Brasserie and Bar has retained its industrial heritage and offers free wi-fi, live jazz concerts, photography exhibitions and more. 

    The menu delights with authentic European cuisine, an all day breakfast and cocktails. Some of the menu specialties are akin to a fine dining restaurant but at value for money prices. It is also the perfect place to enjoy a nice Sunday brunch with food critics claiming we have ‘kick ass burgers’!
